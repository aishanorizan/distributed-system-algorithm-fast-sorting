Speeding Up Heavy Sorting Tasks using Distributed Services and Multithreading Concept 

We all want processing to be quick, dont we? Even when it takes 1 million job executions!

This is a comprehensive algorithm in speeding up a computation intensive problem using distributed system concept.

The program can be speed up by distributing the sorting efforts using numbers of process and thread, which can be located within a machine or spread to different machines. 

The load balancer is will balance the jobs and distributed them to three different servers, and then collects back the results. 
The three servers uses a merge sort algorithm and it also implements multithreading for concurrent job processing in giving faster results.
